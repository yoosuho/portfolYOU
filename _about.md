# **About Me**

Hi, Iâ€™m **{{ site.author.name }}** ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a systems engineer specializing in **UAM (Urban Air Mobility)** and **robotics-integrated aircraft**. Iâ€™ve led the development of full-scale electric propulsion aircraftâ€”from concept design to flight validationâ€”by bridging mechanical design, embedded control, and high-voltage battery system integration.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve personally:
- Welded and assembled airframes without jigs
- Designed and fabricated custom high-voltage battery packs
- Developed STM32-based BMS and integrated them via **UAVCAN** into flight systems
- Built and tuned flight control architectures using **Pixhawk**, **ESCs**, and real-time PID feedback
- Conducted vibration analysis and fault-tolerant testing under motor loss conditions
- Executed actual **manned and unmanned flight tests**, including safety tether validations and autonomous flight logging

My projects go beyond simulation. Everything I build is designed to **fly**, **fail**, and **fly againâ€”better**. I believe that real engineering starts when CAD ends and the grinder begins.

Currently, Iâ€™m preparing for advanced studies and research in **aerospace systems**, **robotic autonomy**, and **experimental aerial platforms**â€”with the goal of contributing to the next generation of safe and intelligent air vehicles.
