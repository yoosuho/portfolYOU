# 👋 Hello, I'm SuHo Yu

I am a systems engineer specializing in Urban Air Mobility (UAM), electric aircraft, and high-performance battery systems.  
Over the past few years, I've led the development and verification of multiple eVTOL and heavy-lift UAV platforms—from prototype to real-world demonstration.  
My experience covers aircraft system integration, DO-160/178C compliance, battery certification, and international test flights.

## ✈️ Key Focus Areas
- UAM/eVTOL System Architecture
- High-Voltage Battery Pack Design & Verification
- Redundant Flight Control Systems
- Airworthiness Certification (UN 38.3, ASTM F2245, DO-160G)
- Government R&D Leadership (PI/PM)

## 🌍 Flight Demonstrations
- ✅ Korea's First Manned UAM Demo (MOLIT 2022)
- ✅ DRIFTx 2024 (Abu Dhabi)
- ✅ AirTaxi World Congress 2024 (UK)
