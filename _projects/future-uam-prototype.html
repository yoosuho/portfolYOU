<h1>🛩️ Future Air Mobility UAM Prototype Development and Flight</h1>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> January 2022 – December 2022<br>
<strong>Lead Organization:</strong> VSPACE<br>
<strong>Role:</strong> Project Lead for Full Aircraft Development</p>

<h2>🔧 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project marks South Korea’s first full-stack development of a single-seat manned eVTOL prototype. I led the full-cycle system integration effort—ranging from CAD design, structural welding, flight controller configuration, battery and BMS development, to actual test flights.
</p>

<p>
The aircraft was a multicopter-type UAM platform, developed from TRL 4 to TRL 5. Key functions—attitude control, propulsion redundancy, and safety verification—were system-integrated and validated in both tethered and untethered test environments.
</p>

<h2>🧠 My Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed aircraft structure and aerodynamic layout using CAD/CAE tools</li>
  <li>Hand-built the airframe through manual TIG welding (no jigs used)</li>
  <li>Integrated 12S high-voltage battery system with STM32-based BMS and UAVCAN communication</li>
  <li>Configured Pixhawk/Cube controller, tuned PID parameters for stable vertical flight</li>
  <li>Performed tethered safety tests, fault handling (motor loss), and hover flight demonstrations</li>
  <li>Led regulatory alignment effort based on AC 21.17-4 for experimental certification</li>
</ul>

<h2>📈 Impact</h2>
<p>
This prototype validated the feasibility of scaling and standardizing manned eVTOLs under Korea's airworthiness frameworks. It contributed to national R&D benchmarking and was featured in Korea’s first urban air mobility demonstration.

<h2>🎥 YouTube Series</h2>
<p>
To document the full build process and technical decisions behind the VS200 eVTOL, I created a detailed 4-part engineering video series.
