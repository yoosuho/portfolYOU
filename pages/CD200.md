<h2>1. Research Overview</h2>
<p>This research focuses on developing a high-power lithium-polymer battery system for South Korea’s first 200 kg-class hydrogen-electric hybrid cargo drone, the KCD-200 UAV, led by LIG Nex1. As the aircraft relies on a hydrogen fuel cell as its primary energy source, it cannot independently handle the high transient power required for takeoff and climb. To solve this, I developed a high-rate battery subsystem that delivers 20C bursts to supplement propulsion and ensures system stability.</p>

<h2>2. Research Motivation</h2>
<p>High-mass UAVs operating with hydrogen fuel cells face critical limitations in handling momentary thrust demands. This research aimed to validate the design, reliability, and hybrid control logic of a lithium battery system that could act as a secondary power source without compromising flight safety. Our challenge was to maintain electrical integrity, ensure thermal safety via air-cooling, and develop structural robustness—all under aviation-grade constraints. We also investigated the implications of non-regulated current return from fuel cells to battery during regenerative modes.</p>

<h2>5. Engineering Approach</h2>
<p>The battery pack comprises 88 cells in series and 4 in parallel, forming a high-voltage (326 V nominal) architecture with built-in air channels and protective structural layout. Each tab was laser-welded using jigs designed for uniformity and minimized resistance. The structure includes embedded busbars rated for transient currents exceeding 400 A. Custom fixtures and balanced weld spacing were used to prevent thermal stress during operation.</p>

</div>
<p>The air-cooling method relies on structural airflow, where battery compartments include dedicated intake/exhaust flow paths. Temperature sensors were placed along the cell array, busbars, and connection plates to monitor localized hot spots during discharge cycles. The system was modeled thermally to anticipate cell heating under 20C loads.</p>

<h2>6. Validation and Testing – Extended Dataset</h2>
<p>We conducted over 100 real-condition ground test cycles without multichannel lab-grade cyclers or temperature chambers. Instead, our iron-bird testbed replicated real propulsion control behavior, including staged load profiles: boost, cruise, and descent. Parameters monitored included voltage sag, IR growth, SoC drift, and heat accumulation. Pack degradation trends were visualized over dozens of cycles to assess reliability.</p>

<p>Test cycles simulated takeoff conditions at full boost where battery provided >20C output, as well as low-rate fuel cell cruise operation. The air-cooling setup proved effective: thermal plateaus remained below 60 °C. Cell balancing by the BMS was confirmed by stable voltage profiles over 20+ consecutive cycles.</p>

<h2>7. Research Outcomes</h2>
<p>The battery successfully demonstrated hybrid operation with hydrogen fuel cell, especially in transient phases. Design elements such as laser welding, structured airflow, and hybrid power management proved reliable under repeated stress. System reliability was further confirmed by negligible performance degradation across all tests.</p>
