## 1. Project Overview

This project addressed one of the most critical challenges in electric aviation: achieving high energy density (Wh/kg) battery packs without compromising power output, structural reliability, and operational safety. The research focused on designing, building, and validating a lithium-ion battery pack that exceeds **250 Wh/kg at the pack level**, delivers high discharge currents (>200A), and complies with rigorous transportation and aviation safety standards (UN 38.3, vibration, short circuit, insulation resistance, etc.).

The battery system was developed to serve **advanced air mobility (AAM)** platforms such as eVTOL aircraft, cargo drones, and hydrogen-electric hybrid propulsion systems.

Developed core electrical and structural architectures based on mission requirements

Designed and validated the battery pack structure through FEA and lab testing

Implemented STM32-based BMS firmware and UAVCAN integration

Conducted UN 38.3, vibration, and thermal compliance testing

Delivered final technology report and government milestone review documentation

## 3. Research Motivation

In the aerospace sector, battery systems face competing demands:

- Increase in energy density ‚Üí lighter aircraft, longer range  
- High power capability ‚Üí necessary for VTOL operations  
- Safety assurance ‚Üí essential for regulatory approval and airworthiness

Conventional battery systems rarely meet all three. Our goal was to **integrate these conflicting requirements into a single, flight-ready system** through engineering-driven research.
