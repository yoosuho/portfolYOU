<h1> Development of 250 Wh/kg-Class High-Dendity,Power Battery System for Electric Aviation </h1>


## 1. Project Overview

This project addressed one of the most critical challenges in electric aviation: achieving high energy density (Wh/kg) battery packs without compromising power output, structural reliability, and operational safety. The research focused on designing, building, and validating a lithium-ion battery pack that exceeds **250 Wh/kg at the pack level**, delivers **8C (720A @ 90Ah)** high discharge, and complies with aviation-grade safety standards such as UN 38.3 and vibration/drop testing.

- **Duration:** Apr 2020 ‚Äì Dec 2023  
- **Funding:** Approx. 3.2M USD  
- **Lead Organization:** VSPACE CO., LTD  
- **Principal Investigator:** SuHo Yu  
- **Participating Organizations:** Sechang Chemical Co., Ltd., Terra Engineering Co., Ltd., Korea Testing & Research Institute (KTR), Tongmyong University  
- **Client Organization:** Hyundai Motor Company

## 2. Research Motivation

In the aerospace sector, battery systems face competing demands:

- Increase in energy density ‚Üí lighter aircraft, longer range  
- High power capability ‚Üí necessary for VTOL operations  
- Safety assurance ‚Üí essential for regulatory approval and airworthiness  

Conventional battery systems rarely meet all three. Our goal was to **integrate these conflicting requirements into a single, flight-ready system** through engineering-driven research.
