<h1>Hybrid Battery System Research for VTOL UAV</h1>

<h2>1. Research Overview</h2>
<p>This research was conducted as a national project initiated by the Korea Coast Guard, led by Vessel Aerospace. The project aimed to design and validate a hybrid battery system integrated into a VTOL UAV platform.</p>

<h2>2. Research Motivation</h2>
<p>Conventional UAVs lack in-flight recharging capability. To meet Korea Coast Guard’s maritime mission needs, we explored a hybrid system with turbine-powered energy recovery and high-discharge battery support (>15C).</p>

<h2>3. Technical Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Design 14s high-rate lithium-ion battery pack</li>
  <li>Enable turbine-powered in-flight charging</li>
  <li>Develop parallel input architecture</li>
  <li>Design for thermal safety and insulation</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. My Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Led entire battery system architecture and layout</li>
  <li>Performed cell testing and BMS firmware development</li>
  <li>Implemented modular design and parallel interfaces</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>5. Engineering Approach</h2>
<p>The battery and BMS were physically separated in the UAV due to thermal and EMI considerations. I designed a distributed layout with EMI shielding and reinforced insulation structures.</p>

<h2>6. Validation and Testing – Extended Dataset</h2>
<p>Validation included Iron Bird ground simulation and tethered hover trials with turbine-charging and battery fallback under failure scenarios.</p>

<h2>7. Research Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Verified high-current operation and in-flight charging functionality</li>
  <li>Validated safety logic and redundancy through simulation and field tests</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Applied Product</h2>
<p>The system is flight-proven, scalable, and applicable to next-gen UAVs, USVs, and hybrid platforms needing endurance and safe redundancy.</p>
