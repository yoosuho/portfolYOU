# Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Type Certification Research (Task 3-1-2)

## 1. Research Overview  
This national research (3-1-2) aims to establish Korea’s first Type Certification (TC) for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Rather than designing a new airframe from scratch, this research focuses on **modifying an existing aircraft** into a compliant Lift & Cruise-type platform. The work is being conducted in collaboration with the **Korea Institute of Aviation Safety Technology (KIAST)** to validate system performance and co-develop a Korean eVTOL certification framework.

## 2. Research Motivation  
eVTOL aircraft introduce unprecedented technical features, such as distributed electric propulsion (DEP), high-voltage battery systems, and full digital flight control. These innovations exceed the boundaries of existing airworthiness frameworks. This research addresses the global certification gap by developing Korea’s own regulatory pathway through real-world aircraft integration and validation.

## 3. Technical Objectives  
- Modify an existing aircraft into a Lift & Cruise configuration  
- Develop TC-compliant power, control, and energy systems  
- Define fail-operational logic and fault-tolerant architectures  
- Generate data-driven safety documents and traceability maps  
- Prepare the aircraft for compliance testing and flight trials  
- Contribute empirical data for shaping eVTOL certification standards  

## 4. My Contributions  
As a systems engineer and participating researcher, I contributed to:
- High-voltage battery system design and integration  
- Low-voltage electrical distribution architecture  
- Distributed propulsion architecture for redundancy  
- Control system layout and FCC/BMS integration  
- Certification planning and CG compliance strategy  
- Technical coordination with KIAST on requirement flow

## 5. Engineering Approach  
The aircraft employs dual power buses, modular batteries, and a redundant FCC control system. Subsystem integration was validated against CG constraints and flight control logic was structured with failover paths. Wiring harness, EMC shielding, and signal routing were engineered based on system-level certification logic.

## 6. Validation and Testing – Extended Dataset  
- System modeling aligned with certification structure  
- CG range validation using simulation and structural modeling  
- Fault scenarios for power transfer and control redundancy  
- EMC simulation and shielding concept validation  
- CFD testing for aerodynamic and lift interference margins  
- Physical integration review during ongoing **system integration and airframe assembly** under TC regulations

## 7. Research Outcomes  
The research has reached the configuration freeze stage, and the team is currently progressing through **system integration and airframe manufacturing** in compliance with TC guidelines. Major outcomes to date include:
- A complete electrical and control architecture for TC  
- CG-verified integration of energy and flight control systems  
- Readiness for ground and flight demonstration  
- Formal contribution to Korean eVTOL certification development
