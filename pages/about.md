# SuHo Yu

Hello! I'm a systems engineer specializing in UAM, eVTOL, electric propulsion systems, and robotics.  
From CAD design to real-world flight, I have hands-on experience in full-stack aerial system development — including CNC machining, embedded systems, and flight testing.

---

# Engineering Philosophy

Engineering, to me, is not just simulation — it's building something that flies, fails, and flies again.  
I've welded frames without jigs, calculated production yield rates, milled custom parts with CNCs, designed batteries and embedded controllers, and proven those systems in the air.

What I value most is the ability to **bridge theory and hardware** — through functional integration, fabrication, and real-world validation.

---

# What I’ve Actually Done

- Welded and assembled full-size airframes by hand without jigs
- Milled components using CNCs and set up toolpaths (Fusion CAM, Mastercam)
- Calculated production yield rates during prototyping-to-manufacturing transitions
- Designed and fabricated custom high-voltage battery packs (12S–156S)
- Developed STM32-based BMS with **UAVCAN**, validated with LDRA (DO-178C)
- Tuned ESCs and PID controllers on **Pixhawk / Cube** platforms
- Conducted vibration analysis and **fault-tolerant control** testing (e.g., single-motor failure on X8)
- Performed **manned and unmanned test flights**, including tether safety validation

All of this was done in **real-world environments**, not just labs or models — from raw aluminum to successful flight.

# My Research Outlook

Across domains like UAM, robotics, and aerial energy systems, I aim to contribute by bringing **full-stack system prototyping and test-driven validation** into academic research.

My focus is on bridging high-level models and real-world systems — especially through:
- Embedded control + battery integration
- Mechanical structure + avionics communication
- Flight validation + safety protocols

Long-term, I hope to become a **system-level engineer and researcher** who can guide experimental aerial systems from concept through certification.

# 🎥 Engineering in the Open

To share what real prototyping looks like — including setbacks, design decisions, and flying outcomes —  
I create detailed technical videos showing how full-stack systems are actually built.
