# üë®‚Äçüíª SuHo Yu

Hello! I'm a systems engineer specializing in UAM, eVTOL, electric propulsion systems, and robotics.  
From CAD design to real-world flight, I have hands-on experience in full-stack aerial system development.
# üß≠ Engineering Philosophy

I believe engineering isn't just about CAD and simulation ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building functional systems that fly, move, or operate under real-world constraints.

Through a series of projects involving manned drones, high-voltage batteries, and flight-tested systems, I‚Äôve built a practical foundation that bridges design, manufacturing, embedded control, and safety validation.

My goal is to connect theory with real-world implementation ‚Äî not just as a user of systems, but as a hands-on integrator.

# üöÄ My Research Outlook

Across domains such as UAM, robotics, and energy systems, I aim to bring **hands-on integration, full-stack prototyping, and test-driven development** into academic research settings.

Whether contributing to battery design, embedded control, or mechanical structure, I focus on building platforms where theory meets physical validation ‚Äî with an emphasis on reproducible, field-tested engineering.

Long-term, I hope to contribute as a **system-level engineer and researcher** capable of translating concepts into validated, operational systems.

# üé• Engineering in the Open

To help others understand how full-stack systems come together ‚Äî from failure to flight ‚Äî I share detailed project videos and technical reflections on YouTube.

# **About Me**

Hi, I‚Äôm **{{ site.author.name }}** üëã  
I‚Äôm a systems engineer specializing in **UAM (Urban Air Mobility)** and **robotics-integrated aircraft**. I‚Äôve led the development of full-scale electric propulsion aircraft‚Äîfrom concept design to flight validation‚Äîby bridging mechanical design, embedded control, and high-voltage battery system integration.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve personally:
- Welded and assembled airframes without jigs
- Designed and fabricated custom high-voltage battery packs
- Developed STM32-based BMS and integrated them via **UAVCAN** into flight systems
- Built and tuned flight control architectures using **Pixhawk**, **ESCs**, and real-time PID feedback
- Conducted vibration analysis and fault-tolerant testing under motor loss conditions
- Executed actual **manned and unmanned flight tests**, including safety tether validations and autonomous flight logging

My projects go beyond simulation. Everything I build is designed to **fly**, **fail**, and **fly again‚Äîbetter**. I believe that real engineering starts when CAD ends and the grinder begins.

Currently, I‚Äôm preparing for advanced studies and research in **aerospace systems**, **robotic autonomy**, and **experimental aerial platforms**‚Äîwith the goal of contributing to the next generation of safe and intelligent air vehicles.
