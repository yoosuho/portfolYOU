# Korea's First Manned All-Electric GA Aircraft Flight ‚Äì Full Technical Research

## 1. Cell Characterization and Pre-Selection

The foundation of a safe and efficient high-voltage battery system begins with rigorous cell-level validation. Over 1,500 cylindrical lithium-ion cells (3.7‚ÄØV, 4.95‚ÄØAh) were pre-screened for capacity consistency, internal resistance, and thermal behavior to ensure performance stability across all 156 series-connected cells in the final pack.

## 2. System Architecture and Modeling

Based on mission load and CG constraints, we developed a split-architecture battery pack system. This included complete CAD and thermal simulations of module enclosures, wiring pathways, and airflow exposure.

## 3. Battery Pack Fabrication and Integration

Two battery packs were constructed: a 156S6P front module and a 156S3P rear module, totaling 1,404 cells. Each module was installed in a sealed aluminum enclosure with IP67-rated protection and structural mounts to withstand 10g acceleration.

## 4. Iron-Bird System Validation

A dedicated iron-bird test rig was assembled to test the full propulsion stack in a controlled environment. These tests confirmed inverter synchronization, regenerative behavior, and fault-handling via CAN communication.

## 5. Ground Environmental Qualification

Prior to flight, we conducted vibration, thermal, IP67, drop, and low-pressure endurance tests. Additionally, ground integration verification was conducted with all systems powered on.

## 6. Aircraft Integration and Pre-Flight Ground Testing

Battery packs were securely installed into the modified KLA-100X airframe. CAN telemetry was verified, and electrical isolation tests were conducted. Taxi tests and static thrust validation followed.

## 7. Manned Flight Test

Korea‚Äôs first manned electric GA aircraft flight was successfully conducted using the in-house developed high-voltage battery system. The flight included low-altitude circuits, data acquisition, and thermal/stability monitoring.
