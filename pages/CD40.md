  <h1>Development of a Hybrid Battery System for a 40 kg-Class Payload Transport UAV</h1>


<div class="portfolio-section">

<h2>1. Research Overview</h2>
<p>
  This national initiative aimed to develop a next-generation hybrid propulsion platform for a 
  <strong>40 kg-class payload transport UAV</strong>. The primary objective was to integrate a 
  reliable, modular battery system into a multirotor drone designed for long-endurance missions 
  with high thrust demands. By leveraging a <strong>gasoline engine for sustained flight</strong> 
  and a <strong>high-discharge lithium-ion battery pack for takeoff and transient boosts</strong>, 
  the system successfully demonstrated hybrid propulsion architecture capable of 
  over 60 minutes of flight time while carrying a 40 kg payload.
</p>
<p>
  The UAV is designed for operational use cases such as emergency logistics, tactical supply, 
  and disaster relief, where a robust and modular power system is essential. 
  The battery system was engineered to deliver <strong>up to 18C instantaneous current</strong> 
  during takeoff and maintain thermal stability throughout all mission phases.

  <h2>2. Research Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Existing electric UAVs often fail to achieve both high-thrust takeoff and extended flight duration due to limitations in battery energy density and discharge capability. Our hybrid concept addresses this challenge by introducing a dual-source power system, where a gasoline engine supplies cruise-level energy and a high-performance battery provides momentary peak power. Unlike traditional drones that rely on a single energy source, this approach ensures that both <strong>power density (W/kg)</strong> and <strong>energy density (Wh/kg)</strong> are optimized without overburdening the weight budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the project emphasized the need for a <strong>field-replaceable modular battery system</strong> to ensure rapid turnaround and serviceability in mission-critical applications.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Technical Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Design and build a battery pack with >250 Wh/kg gravimetric energy density</li>
    <li>Support sustained discharge up to 18C without thermal runaway</li>
    <li>Integrate STM32-based BMS for real-time cell balancing, protection, and CAN communication</li>
    <li>Engineer modularity to allow quick swap-in/out of sub-packs</li>
    <li>Achieve seamless hybrid coordination with ICE generator under dynamic flight conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Engineering Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Our system uses parallel cell grouping to reduce per-cell discharge stress during takeoff, effectively distributing current load and minimizing risk of overheating. The thermal layout includes aluminum heat sinks and active air channels. We also performed finite element simulations to optimize vibration damping mounts and ensure mechanical stability under turbulent flight conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Key innovation involved mapping <strong>internal resistance variation as a function of temperature</strong>, allowing the BMS to predict voltage sag and compensate during real-time flight. This control method greatly enhanced pack reliability under sub-zero conditions.

  <h2>6. Validation and Testing – Extended Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    The full system underwent extensive validation, including thermal chamber testing, repeated 18C burst discharge cycles, and drop tests. The iron-bird integration phase provided critical data on power transitions between the battery and gasoline generator. All mission profiles were simulated with real motor loads to verify controller stability and thermal consistency.
