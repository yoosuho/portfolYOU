# ✈️ Where Systems Engineering Meets the Sky

I am SuHo Yu, a hands-on aerospace & robotics systems engineer.

I specialize in building electric propulsion platforms, high-voltage energy systems, and autonomous aerial vehicles —  
from 3D design to real-world flight tests.

Flight-proven. Government-backed. Ready for the next frontier.
